# Super Maps

A travel guide for you wherever you go, whenever you go!
(Now that is a thing you need to pack before leaving!!)

## Version - 1.3 (Beta)
Yeah, this is a testing phase and it is only made for laptops and big screen devices. Here are the things you find:
- Location Options:
    - Choose the starting position
    - Choose the ending destination
- Basic Zoom
- Compass
- A World Map (off course!!)

## Stuff Used
Since this the testing phase, I really decided to keep the things simple and only used:
- Mapbox SDK
    - Map
    - Zoom
    - Compass
    - Navigation
- React (Interface)
- Firebase (Deployment)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [localhost](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
